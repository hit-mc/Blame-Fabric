# Blame

When you find something has been messed up in the Minecraft server you're managing, then who to blame?

*Blame* records players' interactions with blocks and entities, thus enabling you to find out the unruly player.

## Usage

- Install MongoDB
- Configure your database in `blame.json` sitting with the server `.jar` file
- Start your server
- Use command `/blame` to look up the history
